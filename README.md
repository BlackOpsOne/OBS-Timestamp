# OBS-Timestamp
A browser source for OBS that allows you to display the current unix timestamp.

## Adding to OBS
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/BlackOpsOne/OBS-Timestamp/releases) and grab the `timestamp.html` file.

2. Go to your OBS, add a `Browser` source, click `OK`.

3. Make sure the `Local file` box is checked, set the path to the location of the `timestamp.html` file you just downloaded.
	- Some have found that putting the width to `375` and the height to `50` work the best.

## Checking Timestamps
You can use the [Epoch Converter](https://www.epochconverter.com) website to check a timestamp, simply type the number into the `Timestamp to Human date` input and you will get the exact date and time that this timestamp was displayed.
